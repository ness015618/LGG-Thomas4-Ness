# Terminal

In this module we will see what is behind this black and white text window and how to make it a close friend!

Please follow the order of the exercises, they are arranged so that they make sense. Sometimes you can skip one and come back to it later, reach out to your coach to be sure. ;)

## ðŸŒ± Must haves
You should be at least go through chapters 1 through 9 (included). 

## ðŸŒ¼ Nice to haves
Chapters 10 and 11 are optional. Go through them if you have the time, but if you're struggling with one of the other chapters, you should focus on that. Ask your coach if you need help!

## ðŸ¤“ Quiz time
Once everybody is done with this part of the course, there is a short Kahoot available to test your knowledge. Get ready!
Don't worry, these quizes will **never** be graded. It is only for you to check if you assimilated the content of this course. If you didn't, you're welcome to come back to it any time!

Enjoy your travel!
